# Accelerated ES6 Training 
This is the code repository for Accelerated ES6 Training, published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course follows a hands-on, example-driven approach to show and explain all important features added to JavaScript. This includes important syntax changes and additions such as let, const, REST, and spread operators and continues with promises, the Reflect API, the Proxy API, maps and sets, tons of new methods and functions, and much more. At the end of the course, we'll even build a complete project, using many of the new features shown throughout the course.
